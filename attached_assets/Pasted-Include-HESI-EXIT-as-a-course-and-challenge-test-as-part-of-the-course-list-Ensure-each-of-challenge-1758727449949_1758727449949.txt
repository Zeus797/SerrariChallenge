Include HESI EXIT as a course and challenge test as part of the course list
Ensure each of challenge tests for each course have 10 multiple choice format questions and do research to ensure each of the questions are actual Mock exam questions and detailed explanations based on actual course work for each of the courses. 
For each of the questions, do not autoadvance to the next question after correct answer and explanation reveal, instead include a “Next” question to proceed to the next question.
After the 10th question for each of the courses, before going to results, include an email grab pop up with the results and feedback screen blurred in the background, for users to insert their email to view results but in a compelling way so that they don’t drop off at this point.
For each of the Performance summary screens under “Study recommendations” we want it to say something like “
“Based on your performance, we recommend our [Course Name] Complete Study Package
Our comprehensive study materials are designed to help you master the concepts and excel in your [Course Name]. Get detailed explanations, practice questions, and study strategies from expert educators.” and have a button that says “Explore Study Materials” that links to the following SerrariEd special course offer page under this Study recommendations card.
